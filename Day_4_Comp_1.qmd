## Making Vectors 

```{r}

#c is concatenate  give it a series of values
rain <- c(3, 5, 10.1, 6)


#scalar multiplication
rain_scaled <- 5* rain


```

## Making matrices

```{r}
#make a sequence of values and then wrap those values into a matrix, one long vector and populate a 3 by 5 matrix with those values, row by row.
#seq needs two things, start value and end value

my_values <- seq(from = 1, to=10 )

#wrapping this into a 2 by 5 matrix by saying:
#know what direction it is populating in , populating by column first byrow=false but it is the default

my_matrix <-matrix(data = my_values, nrow=2, ncol=5, byrow= TRUE)
```

```{r}
my_matrix2 <- matrix(data= my_values, nrow=3, ncol=4, byrow= TRUE)

#warning says we don't have a complete set of multiples of our original sequence, then it starts repeating. 
```

```{r}
matrixA <- matrix(data = seq( from =2, to =5, length =10),
                  nrow= 2,
                  ncol=5,
                  byrow= TRUE)
```

Matrix addition/subtraction

```{r}
my_matrix + matrixA
```
